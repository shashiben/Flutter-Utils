  /// üìå Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// Row(
  ///   children: [
  ///     Icon(Icons.star),
  ///     8.horizontalBox, // Adds 8 pixels of horizontal spacing

  /// - If the number is a `double`, it is treated as **fractional seconds**.

  /// ```dart
  /// await 2.delayed(); // Waits for 2 seconds
  /// await 1.5.delayed(); // Waits for 1.5 seconds (1500ms)
  /// print('Executed after delay');
